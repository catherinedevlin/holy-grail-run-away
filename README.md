# Run Away!

Two small games demonstrated at Dayton's 
Victoria Theater to celebrate their screening
of Monty Python and the Holy Grail.

They could use a little refactoring before 
being held up as great examples.

## rabbit.py 

Escape the killer Rabbit of Caerbannog 
by quickly clopping coconut halves together.

Or making any other loud noise, but c'mon,
use the coconuts.

Or by using the cursor keys, but c'mon, 
use the coconuts.

Uses the `arcade` and `slowclap`
libraries.

## trivia.py 

Cross the Bridge of Death by answering 
Monty Python trivia questions.


Uses the `enquiries` library.
